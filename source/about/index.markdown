### Hey there,

my name is *Andreas Tiefenthaler* and I currently live and work in Vienna, Austria.

I am interested in all kinds of technologies, music, random stuff and like to play around with them. This blog is a documentation for myself on things I played with or that crossed my way.

If you like what you see, have some suggestions or just wanna say HI just drop me a line at <a href="mailto:hello@an-ti.eu">hello@an-ti.eu</a>.
